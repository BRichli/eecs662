# Syllabus

## Topics

* Programs as Data Structures
* Identifiers and Substitution

## Grading

Grades are assigned on a standard 10 point scale:

* A = 90-100%
* B = 80-90%
* C = 70-80%
* D = 60-70%
* F = 0-60%

I do not use a +/- grading scale.

Classroom tasks are weighted using the following scale:

* Midterm Exam 20%
* Final Exam 20%
* Assignments 60%

You must pass both projects and homework, and exams separately to pass the class. If you score less than 60% on your projects and homework or less than 60% on your exams, you will not pass the course.

## Assignments

You will perform several projects that involve developing code using the Racket programming language. These projects are an exceptionally important part of the course and provide insight into building interpreters that cannot be gained from lectures or exams. Programming projects will be assigned every 1-2 weeks. Please use KUâ€™s Canvas system for submissions.

The [Assignments]({{site.baseurl}}/assignments) page will list all assignments for the class.

## Exams

All exams are closed book, closed notes exams. Our final exam will be held as scheduled by KU.

* Midterm Exam - March 7 in class
* Final Exam - TBD

If you have a conflict with my office hours, please make an appointment. I have an open door policy, you are free to come by whenever you choose during my office hours time.

### Cheating

Academic misconduct of any kind will automatically result in a 0 score on the homework, lab, project, or exam in question and your actions will be reported to the department chair. Your homework, exams and projects must be individually prepared unless otherwise noted. Posting your assignments to internet discussion lists is considered academic misconduct. Sharing your solutions with others is considered academic misconduct. Turning in solutions from previous semesters is considered academic misconduct. Paying people to prepare solutions is academic misconduct. Automated mechanisms are available for checking the originality of source code.

### Excuses

Excusing a missed exam or assignment is left to the discretion of the instructor. Illness, family emergencies, and religious observances are examples of acceptable excuses. Computer down time, over sleeping, and social events are examples of unacceptable excuses. Please try to let me know of problems in advance when possible and be prepared to provide verification of your excuse.
