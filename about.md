Programming Languages is an introduction to basic principles of defining, describing and implementing programming languages and their interpreters. The fundamental goal is establishing a vocabulary for discussing what programming languages and programs written in them do. Topics covered to accomplish this are data representation and types; declarations, bindings and variable assignment; parameter passing and function evaluation; statements; and objects and types. The course uses an implementation-based approach with students developing interpreters for languages that demonstrate features presented in class.

### Communications

All official communications for the class will be through [Canvas](https://canvas.ku.edu/courses/105419).
